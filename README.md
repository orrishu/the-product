# Coffee Scheduler Gantt

## The way to consume your favorite coffee.  

This document describes the schedule of the desired consuming espresso times (=The Product).  
it is a hard schedule and can only be changed by The Product maintainers.  

Should anyone has a suggestion of changing something in the schedule, please submit a PR and we promise to discuss it thoroughly.  
We do not promise however to accept the change as we are really tight in the current schedule.  
You are welcome to fork that repo and make your own changes if you have to  
(but we strongly recommend **not to do so**).  


*todo* add description of the current gantt
